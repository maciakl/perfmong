# What is it? #

PerfMonG is a minimalistic performance monitor tool for Windows written in C#. It will sit on your desktop and display information such as CPU speed, free RAM, uptime and etc. The positioning of the tool, opacity and colors are configurable.

This project aims to provide a small and simple to use application with functionality similar to [Samurize](http://www.samurize.com/modules/news/) or Linux/Unix based [GKrellM](http://members.dslextreme.com/users/billw/gkrellm/gkrellm.html). PerfMonG is much simpler, requires no configuration and is ready to use in seconds.

# Requirements #

You will need .NET Framework 1.1 or higher to use PerfMonG. You can download the redistributable package from [Microsoft Website](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0856EACB-4362-4B0D-8EDD-AAB15C5E04F5&displaylang=en).

The product was tested with Windows XP.

Note: PerfMonG 0.2.5 and lower will not work on Windows 2000 and below. See [Issue 9](https://code.google.com/p/perfmong/issues/detail?id=9). These versions require Windows XP. Versions 0.2.6 and above will work on Windows 2000 with limited functionality.

  * CPU Usage (in %)
